# üë®‚Äçüéì Education

I am a Ph.D. candidate (2022--) at College of Informatics, Huazhong Agricultural University, supervised by [Prof. Hong Chen](https://chenhongml.github.io/). Previously, I was persuing the M.S. degree (2020-2022) with assistance of [Prof. Lingjuan Wu](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Lingjuan-Wu). I received the B.S. degree in Engineering from China Agricultural University in 2020. 

# üî¨ Research Area

My research interests lie in the areas of optimization and learning theory, with emphasis on the following topics:

- Automatic machine learning/LLM (e.g., **Hyperparameter Optimization**, **Hallucination Detection**)

- Robust/Interpretable machine learning (e.g., **Robust Metric**, Sparse/Neural **Additive Models**)

- Applications in hardware security (e.g., **Trojan Detection** at FPGA/Gate/LUT Synthetic Levels)

Some suggested videos for better understanding the [bilevel optimization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTDrSjBtKLc), [robust machine learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IgAPc0i0-9E), [interpretable additive models](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aMB51GMUyQ) as well as the [hardware Trojans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VL3kizVud9Q).

- This study establishes a theoretical framework for Next-Token-Prediction (NTP) pre-training based on Rademacher complexity, introduces a novel decomposition method, and provides the first generalization bounds for NTP. The findings offer valuable insights into how model parameters influence generalization and have been empirically validated, advancing both the theoretical comprehension and practical application of large language models.
